# Pybuildc
Build system for the C language. For me a build system has to do a few things:

1. Only compile the changed file of a project to save compile-time.
2. Handle dependecies
3. change between Debug and Release flags
4. Automatic testing

### Install
```terminal
pip install .
```


### Usage
```terminal
pybuildc build
```
